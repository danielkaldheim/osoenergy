# OSO Energy

In lack of a home assistant component in official Home Assistant integration list or in HACS for OSO Energy InCharge Hot Water Boiler, I have cloned [@osohotwateriot](https://github.com/osohotwateriot) component from [https://github.com/osohotwateriot/core/tree/osoenergy/homeassistant/components/osoenergy](https://github.com/osohotwateriot/core/tree/osoenergy/homeassistant/components/osoenergy)

## Frontend

[@osohotwateriot](https://github.com/osohotwateriot) have also created a Lovelace card which is available here: [OSO Energy Water Heater cards](https://github.com/osohotwateriot/ha-osoenergy-waterheater-cards)


## Description

The OSO Energy integration for Home Assistant allows you to interact with supported devices and services offered by [OSO Energy](https://www.osoenergy.no)

This OSO Energy integration uses a subscription key, which a user can create for his account on the [OSO Energy website](https://portal.osoenergy.no/), to configure it within Home Assistant. Once configured Home Assistant will detect and add all OSO Energy devices.
